## Detailed User Guide

### Getting Started

When you first open the app, you'll see:
- The title "Christmas Lights Photo App" at the top
- Two tabs labeled "Use Camera" and "Upload Image"
- The "Use Camera" tab is selected by default

The interface is designed with a clean, modern aesthetic using a light color scheme with blue and green accent colors for buttons and interactive elements.

### Image Input Methods

#### Using Your Camera

1. **Starting the Camera**:
   - In the "Use Camera" tab, you'll see a camera icon placeholder with text "Camera inactive"
   - Click the green "Start Camera" button
   - Your browser will prompt for camera permissions - you must allow this for the app to function
   - If you deny permission, an error message will appear explaining the issue

2. **Camera View**:
   - Once permissions are granted, your device's camera feed will appear in the view
   - The app defaults to your rear-facing camera (if available) as it's typically better for photos
   - The "Start Camera" button is replaced with a blue "Take Photo" button

3. **Taking a Photo**:
   - Position your device to frame the area where you want to add Christmas lights
   - Click the "Take Photo" button to capture the image
   - The camera will immediately stop after capturing to save resources

#### Uploading an Image

1. **Selecting the Upload Tab**:
   - Click the "Upload Image" tab at the top of the screen
   - The interface changes to show an upload icon with "Upload an image" text

2. **Choosing a File**:
   - Click the "Choose Image" button
   - Your device's file browser will open
   - The app accepts standard image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
   - Select your desired image and confirm

3. **Image Preview**:
   - After selection, your image appears in the preview area
   - A green "Use This Image" button appears below the preview
   - Click this button to proceed to the editing phase

### Editing Interface

After providing an image through either method, the app transitions to the editing view where you'll create and customize your Christmas lights.

#### Layout Overview

The editing interface consists of:
- A main canvas showing your image where you'll draw light paths
- A sidebar on the left with control sliders and color settings
- A row of control buttons at the bottom
- An instruction text above the buttons
- Multiple invisible overlay canvases for different visualizations

#### Processing Stage

1. **Initial Processing**:
   - The app shows a "Processing image..." overlay with a progress bar
   - During this time, the app is:
     - Sending your image to servers for depth analysis (detecting 3D structure)
     - Detecting lines in the image to help with light placement
     - Preparing the canvas for drawing
   - This typically takes 3-10 seconds depending on your connection speed
   - If server connection fails, the app will enter a "basic mode" and notify you

2. **Canvas Preparation**:
   - Your image is resized to fit the square canvas area
   - Multiple canvas layers are initialized:
     - Base canvas with your image
     - Lights overlay for the animated lights
     - Depth overlay (hidden by default) showing 3D structure
     - Line overlay (hidden by default) showing detected edges

#### Drawing Light Paths

Once processing completes, you'll see the instruction "Click to add points for your Christmas lights" and can begin creating your light patterns.

1. **Basic Point Placement**:
   - Click anywhere on your image to place a light point
   - The first click creates a starting point
   - The second click creates another point and connects them with a line
   - Each subsequent click extends the path by adding more connected points
   - You're essentially drawing paths along which lights will be displayed

2. **Snapping to Lines**:
   - The app helps you align points to detected lines in the image
   - When clicking near a detected line (like a roof edge), your point will "snap" to it
   - This creates more natural-looking light placements along architectural features
   - You can see detected lines by clicking the "Toggle Line Data" button

3. **Creating Multiple Paths**:
   - To start a new, separate light path, click away from existing paths
   - To branch a path, click on an existing point and then click elsewhere
   - To connect separate paths, click on an endpoint of one path and then an endpoint of another

4. **Editing Points**:
   - Click and drag any existing point to move it
   - Points will still snap to detected lines when moved near them
   - The connected light paths update in real-time as you move points

5. **Visualizing Depth**:
   - Click the "Toggle Depth Map" button to see the depth analysis
   - Brighter areas are detected as closer to the camera
   - Darker areas are detected as farther away
   - This affects how lights are rendered (closer lights appear larger)

6. **Control Buttons**:
   - "Undo": Removes the last action (point placement, movement, etc.)
   - "Clear All": Removes all points and paths, letting you start over
   - "Start Over": Returns to the initial screen to choose a new image
   - "Toggle Depth Map": Shows/hides the depth visualization
   - "Toggle Line Data": Shows/hides the detected line visualization

#### Real-time Light Animation

As you draw paths, Christmas lights automatically animate along them:

1. **Light Placement**:
   - Lights appear as colored dots with glowing effects along your drawn paths
   - The lights are spaced according to the current density setting
   - They're sized according to the depth map (larger in foreground, smaller in background)
   - Lights animate with a twinkling motion along the paths

2. **Animation Controls**:
   - "Pause Animation" toggles the animation on/off (button text changes accordingly)
   - "Hide Splines" toggles the visibility of your drawn paths (button text changes accordingly)

#### Downloading The Current Canvas
At any time, you can download the current canvas state (with lights, splines, depthmap, etc) as a PNG image

### Customizing Light Properties

The sidebar provides controls to customize your Christmas lights:

#### Density Slider

Located at the top of the sidebar:
- Slide up to increase light density (more lights along each path)
- Slide down to decrease light density (fewer lights along each path)
- Default value is center position (1.0x density)
- Range is from 0.5x (sparse) to 2.0x (dense)
- Changes apply instantly to all lights

#### Color Bar

Located in the middle of the sidebar:
- The color bar shows the current color gradient used for lights
- By default, it's initialized with red at top, blue in middle, red at bottom
- Click anywhere on the color bar to add a new color marker
- When clicked:
  - A color picker overlay appears
  - Select your desired color
  - Click "Select" to apply the color at that position
  - Click "Cancel" to exit without changes

- **Managing Color Markers**:
  - Each marker appears as a colored dot on the right side of the bar
  - Click a marker to edit its color (picker will show current color)
  - Click the top-right of a marker (where an "Ã—" appears on hover) to delete it
  - Colors between markers are automatically blended
  - Lights change color based on their position in the animation sequence

#### Speed Slider

Located below the color bar:
- Slide up to increase animation speed
- Slide down to decrease animation speed
- Default value is center position (1.0x speed)
- Range is from 0.1x (very slow) to 2.0x (very fast)
- Affects how quickly lights cycle through the pattern

#### Glow Size Slider

Located at the bottom of the sidebar:
- Slide up to increase the glow size around each light
- Slide down to decrease the glow size
- Default value is center position (1.0x size)
- Range is from 0.5x (subtle glow) to 3.0x (large glow)
- Changes apply instantly to all lights

### Enhancing Your Image

Once you're satisfied with your light setup, you can apply AI enhancement:

1. **Starting Enhancement**:
   - Click the green "Enhance Image" button (only active once you've created light paths)
   - A processing overlay appears with the message "Enhancing with AI... This may take a few seconds"
   - This process sends your image and light overlay to the Stability AI API
   - The enhancement process typically takes 15-30 seconds

2. **Enhancement Process**:
   - During enhancement, the app:
     - Creates a combined image with your photo and lights
     - Communicates with the Stability AI API
     - Uses the depth information to create a more realistic effect
     - Applies artistic enhancements to make the lights pop
     - Adjusts the scene lighting to create a nighttime effect

3. **Result View**:
   - When complete, the enhanced image replaces your original
   - The instruction text changes to "Your enhanced image is ready!"
   - Your original drawing tools and controls are hidden

### Saving Your Creation

1. **Downloading Your Image**:
   - Click the blue "Download Image" button
   - The enhanced image is saved to your device with the filename "christmas-lights-photo-enhanced.png"
   - If enhancement failed for any reason, you'll still be able to download the non-enhanced version

2. **Starting Over**:
   - To create another image, click the "Start Over" button
   - This resets the app completely and returns you to the initial screen

### Advanced Interactions

#### Touch Support
- The app fully supports touch interactions on mobile devices
- You can draw, move points, adjust sliders, and control all features via touch
- Sliders have special touch handling to prevent page scrolling while adjusting

#### Network Creation
- When drawing paths, you can create complex networks of connected lights
- Lights will flow through the entire network in a consistent pattern
- You can create loops, branches, and multiple isolated networks
- Color cycling is synchronized across connected paths

#### Error Handling
- If servers are unavailable, the app falls back to basic mode
- If camera access fails, detailed error messages explain the issue
- If enhancement fails, you can still download the non-enhanced version
- All error states provide actionable information to the user

#### Technical Details
- The app caches depth values for better performance
- Animations use request/cancelAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
- The light rendering uses "lighter" composite mode for better glow effects
- Depth and line data are downsized for faster server processing

#### Browser and Device Support
- The app works on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile devices are fully supported with responsive layout adjustments
- Camera functionality requires a device with a camera and browser permissions
- Processing speed varies based on device capabilities and connection speed
